# Credit Card Default Analysis - Power BI

This Power BI project investigates **credit card default patterns** across various demographic dimensions such as **education level**, **age**, **sex**, **state**, and **marital status**. The objective is to identify key trends and risk segments that influence the likelihood of credit card defaults.

## Key Visual Insights

* **Default by Education Level and Sex**
  Visualizes default counts across **graduate**, **undergraduate**, **high school**, and **unknown education** categories, segmented by **male** and **female**.

* **Default by Age and Sex**
  Reveals how **default rates vary across age groups**, with sex-wise comparison, highlighting age segments with higher risk.

* **Default by Sex**
  A direct comparison of total defaults among **males and females**.

* **Default by Marital Status and Sex**
  Shows default distribution across **single, married**, and **unknown marital statuses**, further broken down by sex.

* **Default by State**
  Geographic view of default counts per **state**.

* **Default Ratio Indicator**
  A KPI card showing the **average default ratio**, which stands at **22%** across the dataset.
